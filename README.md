# ElectronicsProject351
This was my final project for my digital electronics course. I created an motion detection alarm system using an STM32F103RB Board. This project also used a PIR motion sensor and a Piezo buzzer as components.<br/>
My project report contains all the details about the system and my project schematic shows how it was constructed. This project was constructed in C. I used pin PA4 for my buzzer and LED, and pin PA6 to read my sensor. This project can be powered off a power outlet or battery pack, the buzzers and LEDs can run off very little power, only the motion sensor requires 5V, as it gives inconsistent readings at 3.3V.
